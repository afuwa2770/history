     <h1>THE STORY OF PROPHET YUSUF(AS)</h1>
     <img src="img/desert.jpg" alt="desert" width="128" height="128">
   <h2>Introduction</h2>


<p><i>Prophet Yusuf(AS) was the son of prophet Ya'qub(AS). The holy quran has mentioned his story in a beautil chapter entitled "surh Yusuf".<br> Yusuf(AS) had 11 brothers and Bunyamin was the youngest.  He was from the same mother as Yusuf(AS) and rest were older half-brothers.<br> Yusuf(AS) possessed excellent character and manners.His father loved him dearly. When Prophet Yususf(AS) was still a young boy,he<br> woke up one glorious morning delighted by a  pleasnt dream he just had.He ran to his father in excitement and said;
     <pre>
     "Oh my father i have indeed seen eleven stars,
      the sun and the moon; prostrating to me."
      </pre>
      Prophet Ya'qub(AS) was over joyed in realisation  that his son was indeed chosen by Allah to be bestowed with prophethood. However,<br> Ya'qub was concerned about his older sons' reaction to this narration even he treated them the same,they harboured jealousy<br> towards Yusuf(AS). He therefore causioned Yusuf(AS) not to tell his brothers, as they would plot for his downfall.</i></p>
<p><i>With the passage of time, the malice in the hearts of Yusfu(AS)'s brothers kept  growing.They envied Yusuf(AS) because they felt that he was special<br> in their father's eyes  and they were not. Being unable to handle their emotions,they devised a plan to somehow get rid of him by throwing him into the<br> well.So whenever they used to take their goats out fro grazing, they asked their father to let Yusuf(AS) to acompany them, but Ya'qub(AS) always refused<br> claiming that Yususf(AS) was still young.When Yususf(AS) turned the age of 16, they approached their father and suggested that  Yusuf(AS) was grown up<br> and that he should come with them to take their goats for grazing. Reluctantly, Ya'qub(AS) said that,
     <pre>
          "indeed, it suddens me that you should take him,
          becuase i fear that the wolf would eat him while 
          you are unaware."
     </pre>
     But the brothers insisted that they would take extra care and Yusuf(AS) would enjoy himself. Prophet Ya'qub(AS) always refused, saying that the boy<br> was too young. When prophet Yusuf(AS) reached the age of 16, his brothers insisted that he was now old enough to acompany them.<br> With relactance their father agreed to let them take him with them.
</i></p>
<p><i>The next day, prophet Yusuf(AS) set off with his brothers and traveled very far in pursuit of a well deep enough to throw their brother in.<br> When they finally reached the well on the pretext of drinking water, they led him to it, grabbed him, and removed his shirt. Prophet Yusuf(AS)<br> began struggling and pleaded with them to let go. But the brothers refuted and  eventually outpowered Yusuf(AS) and threw him down the well,<br> left him to die, then rushed back home.   
On their way back home, they slaughtered a goat and stained prophet Yusuf"s(AS) shirt with it's blood.<br> They arrived home wheeping and crying, and told their father that,
<pre>
     "Oh father, we indeed went racing and  
     left Yusuf(AS) garzing the sheeps and 
     the wolf ate him."
</pre>
Prophet Ya'qub(AS)  was suspicious and did not believe their story, as in his heart, believed that his son was still alive and the brothers were probably influenced by<br> satan to do evil. Prophet Ya'qub remarked that the wolf was indeed merciful to have eaten his son without tearing his shirt. he bored the bravement with patience<br> and prayed for his son's safe return.</i></p>
<p><i>Meanwhile,  Prophet Yusuf(AS) managed to climb onto a stone ledge, and paryed to Allah to grant him salvation. soon, a caravan bound for Egypt stopped at<br> this well to drink water. As the backet was drawn into the well to fetch water, prophet Yusuf(AS) came up holding on it. The water drawer was shocked to see a<br> handsome boy clinging on the rope. The caravan people immediately shackled prophet Yusuf(AS) and  took  him along to Egypt. </i> </p>

<h2>Prophet Yusuf(AS)  in Egypt</h2>

<p><i>As prophet Yusuf(AS) arrived in Egypt, he was auctioned  and sold as a slave to the highest bidder known as Al-Azeez  who happened to be the treasurer.<br>Prophet Yusuf's new master who had no children,was completely taken with prophet Yusuf(AS). He told his wife(Zulaikha) to take good care of  prophet<br> Yusuf(AS) and that they could either use him as a slave or take him for a son. </i></p>
<p><i>Prophet Yusuf(AS) not only grew up with exceptional knowledge and wisdom by Allah, he was also extremely handsome. His honesty won the heart of Al-Azeez<br> and placed him in charge of the household. During this period, prophet Yusuf(AS) was confronted with his second trial. Zulaikha(Al-Azeez's wife)who watched prophet<br> Yusuf(AS) day after day, began to feel pationately about him.Her obsession heightened to a degree where she was desperate to fulfill her desire.</i></p>
<p><i>One day when her husband was away from home, Zulaikha closed all the doors and invited prophet Yusuf(AS) to her. Due to prophet Yusuf(AS) fearing Allah, he replied,
     <pre>
          "[I seek] refuge in Allah.
          Indeed,he is my master,who
          has made my good residence.
          Indeed wrongdoers will not
          succeed. "
     </pre> 
     He turned away and ran towards the closed doors to escape. Zulaikha chased after himin desparation and grabbed his shirt from the back which caused his shirt to rip.<br> But the prophet Yusuf(AS) managed to open the door and Al-Azeez entered, being ashamed, Zulaikha ran to him and cried,
     <pre>
          "What is the recompence of the one
           who intended evil for your wife
           but that he be imprisoned or a 
           painful punishement?"
     </pre>
     Prophet Yususf(AS) was baffled and continued to deny his mistress's claim saying,
     <pre>
          "It was she who sought to seduce me."
     </pre>
     </i></p>
     <p><i>Al-Azeez was confused and unsure of who to believe, being a fair man , he consulted his wife's cousin for some advise. Zulaikha"s cousin advised him that,
          <pre>
               "If the shirt is torn from the front,
               then she has told the truth,and he is
               of the liars."
          </pre>
          Prophet Yusuf's(AS) innocence was proven and Al-Azeez appologised for his wife's indecency and swore prophet Yusuf(AS) to secrecy.
     </i></p>
     <p><i>Never the less, the story of Zulaikha all over the town and her fellow women started ridculing her character. Depressed, Zulaikha planned to prove to them her<br> helpless reaction to prophet Yusuf's extra ordinary handsomeness.Zulaikha decided to invite these women to a banquet at her residence one day, and she served<br> them fruits along with knives. The women had to slice the fruits using the knives she had served them.As the women were chatting away while slicing fruits,<br> Zulaikha summoned prophet Yusuf and all women looked up at him.Astonished at such angelic beauty, they cut their hands without even realising that they were<br> doing so. Zulaikha  seized the moment to anounce that, this was the man for whom she was blamed. She then warned prophet Yusuf that if he denied her again,<br> she will be imprisoned and prophet Yusuf replied that,
     <pre>
          "My lord,prison is more to my liking
          than that to which they invite me."
     </pre>
          That night Zulaikha convinced her husband that the only way to safeguard her honor and his prestige was to imprison prophet Yusuf(AS). In this case<br> prophet Yusuf(AS) was thrown to jail.  </i></p>
          <p><i>During prophet Yusuf's time in prison, he was bestowed with the ability to interpret dreams. Two of prophet Yusuf's cell mates, mesmirizedby his piety,<br> sought him to have their dreams interpreted and explained. One of them dreamt that he was serving the king wine, and the other one dreamt that he was carrying<br> bread on his head which two birds were eating up. Prophet Yusuf initially called them to Allah, then interpreted,
          <pre>
               "Oh two companions of prison,
               as for one of you, he will 
               give a drink of wine to his 
               master. And as fo the other
               one, he will be crucified,
               and the birds will eat from 
               his head. The matter has decreed
               about which you both inquire."
          </pre>
          And he said to the one whom he knew would go free,
     <pre>
          "Mention me before your master."
     </pre>
        But satan made him forget to mention to his master like prophet Yusuf(AS) had told him. Hence prophet Yusuf(AS) remained in prison for years.</i></p>
        <p><i>Then one day, the king of Egypt had an odd dream. He summoned his men and said,
          <pre>
               "Indeed, i have seen seven fat cows
               being eaten by seven lean and seven
               green spikes of grain and others That
               were dry . Oh eminent ones,explain to me
               my vision, if you know how to interpret visions. "
          </pre>
          The cubearer, who immediately remembered his companion in prison, he informed the king about prophet Yusuf(AS) and his impeccable dream interpretations.<br>The king sent off his cubearer to prison to meet with prophet Yusuf and inquire about the peciliar dream. </i></p>
          <p><i>Prophet Yusuf(AS) was overjoyed at the sight of his companion knowing it very well that it was Allah's plan. He narrated to him,
               <pre>
                    "You will plant for seven consecutive
                    years, and what you harvest, leave it
                    in it's spikes except a little from 
                    which you will eat.Then will come 
                    after seven difficult years which will
                    consume what you savedfor them,except a
                    little frm which you will store. Then
                    will come after that a year in which the
                    people will be given rain and in which
                    they will press olives and grapes."
               </pre></i></p>
               <p><i>Amuzed was the king, he then ordered prophet Yusuf(AS) to be presented before him. Prophet Yusuf(AS) however refused to leave prison before<br> his innocence was proved. Hence, the king summoned all women relating to prophet Yusuf's incident. All the women who had their hands cut,spoke<br> of prophet Yusuf's(AS) innocence before the king,(verse 51 surah Yusuf)
               <pre>
                    "Allah preserve us! no evil 
                    we know about him."
               </pre>
          Zulaikha was trapped and confessed to the king,
     <pre>
          "Now the truth has become evident,
          it was i who sought to seduce him,
          and indeed he is truethful."
     </pre>
          That's how prophet Yusuf's(AS) innocence was proven and then got released from prison. Prophet Yusuf(AS), stood before the king and thanked him for<br> his generosity. The king was greatly impressed by prophet Yusuf's honest mannerisms and his pleasant personality. And he appointed him as the storekeeper<br> over the store houses across his land.</i></p>
          <p><i>Prophet Yusuf(AS), harvested and stored crops during the seven years of fertility. When the years of faminine came, it also reached the house of prophet Ya'qub(AS)<br> in Canaan. Prophet ya'qub(AS) sent all his sons except Bunyamin to Egypt to purchase provisions. Prophet Yusuf(AS) immediately recognised his brothers<br> and provided for them, however kept his identity diguised. He casually inquire about their family. And they informed him about their father and brother they left back home.<br> So,prophet Yusuf(AS) informed him to bring their younger brother next time or they shall receive no further provisions. He also placed the money they had paid with their<br> supplies as an incentive to return.</i></p>
          <p><i> When prophet Yusuf's(AS) brothers returned home, they told their father that,
               <pre>
                    "Oh our father, measure has been denied to us,
                    so send our brother with us so that we willbe
                    given measure. And indeed we will be his gardians. "
               </pre>
          Prophet Ya'qub(AS) was enraged and asked himself how he could trust them when they failed him terribly with prophet Yusuf(AS) before. After some time, their<br> needs forced prophet Ya'qubto send Bunyamin with them for more provisions. He took their solemn oathto safeguard him. When they reached Egypt, prophet Yusuf(AS) drew<br> Bunyamin aside and whispered in his ear,
          <pre>
               "Indeed i am your brother, so
               do not despair over what they 
               used to do to me."
          </pre> 
          The following day,prophet Yusuf(AS) filled his brothers' bags with grain. He then secretly planted the king's golden bowl in Bunyamin's bag. </i></p>
          <p><i>On departing, the brothers were stopped by the king's soldiers  who were looking for the king"s missing cup. Their bags  were searched and the missing cup was retrieved<br> from the bag of the youngest brother Bunyamin. The soldiers yelled,
               <pre>
                    "Oh caravan,indeed you are thieves."
               </pre>
          The brothers were shocked! and they emmediately remembered their sick father back home and their vow to safeguard Bunyamin at all cost. They begged the soldiers to<br> release their younger brother and take one of them instead but the soldiers refused.The eldest among the brothers said,
     <pre>
          "I will never leave this land
          until my father permits me or
          Allah decides for me."
     </pre>
          So the rest of the brothers left leaving the eldest behind in Egypt.</i></p>
     <p><i>When prophet Ya'qub(AS) learnt of Bunyamin's predicament, he wept until he became blind. He resorted to prayer for comfort for he knew that only Allah<br> could ease his pain. He later instructed his sons to return to Egypt and inquire about their elder  brother.</i></p>
     <p><i>When the sons returned to Egypt just like their father had instructed them, they met with prophet Yusuf(AS) and pleaded that trgedy has befallen them.<br> Prophet Yusuf(AS) spoke to them in their native language and asked,
          <pre>
               "Do you remember what you did to your 
               brother Yusuf when you were still
               ignorant?"
          </pre>
          It didn't take long for the to notice that this was their long lost brother. They then started to tremble in fear but prophet Yusuf(AS) conforted them by saying
     <pre>
          "No reproach on you this day,
          may Allah forgive you."
     </pre> 
         He then said;
         <pre>
          "Take this shirt(prophet Yusuf(AS)'s shirt)
          and cast it over the face of my father,he will
          regain his eyesight."
         </pre> </i></p>
     <p><i>They (Yusuf(AS)'s brthers) then returned to their father and casted the shirt over his face as they were instructed by prophet Yusuf(AS). Miraculously, Allah<br>  restored prophet Ya'qub(AS)'s eyesight.They asked their father to seek Allah's forgiveness for them. Together with their father,set off to Egypt and prophet<br> Yusuf(AS) warmly welcomed them.Prophet Yusuf(as) raised their father upon the throne and said,
     <pre>
          "Oh father,this is the explanation of
           my vision of before. My Lord has made
           it real. And he was certainly good to 
           me when HE took me out of prison and 
           brought you here after satan had induced 
           between me and my brothers. Indeed Allah
           is subtle in what he wills.Indeed HE is 
           all Knowing and Wise. "
     </pre>
          Hence, father and son were reunited.</i></p>

          <P>LESSON SUMMERY:<br>1. No matter how hard life would be, we should always put our trust in Allah.<br>2. We should always be patient and grateful in all situations for Allah is always with the patient.<br>3. We always have to be forgiving no matter how hard it would be.<br> </P>
